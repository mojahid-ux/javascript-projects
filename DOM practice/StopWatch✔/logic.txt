Stopwatch Logic with Milliseconds

Start action

Record the current time (startTime).

Begin a loop (using a very small interval, e.g., every 10ms).

Elapsed time calculation

At each tick:

elapsedTime = currentTime - startTime


Now break it down:

Hours = (elapsedTime / (1000 * 60 * 60)) % 24

Minutes = (elapsedTime / (1000 * 60)) % 60

Seconds = (elapsedTime / 1000) % 60

Milliseconds = (elapsedTime % 1000)

Stop (Pause)

Stop the loop.

Store the last elapsedTime.

Resume

Adjust the startTime so it accounts for the already elapsed time:

startTime = currentTime - elapsedTime


This makes sure it doesn‚Äôt restart from 0.

Reset

Set elapsedTime = 0.

Display 00:00:00.000.

üîπ In Simple Words

The stopwatch doesn‚Äôt count forward like adding +1 every second.

Instead, it constantly asks:

‚ÄúHow much time has passed since I started?‚Äù

By using milliseconds from the system clock, it can show results like:

00:01:23.456  ‚Üí  0 hours, 1 minute, 23 seconds, 456 milliseconds
